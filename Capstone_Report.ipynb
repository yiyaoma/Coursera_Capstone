    "Jack Lee is currently living in **Flushing, Queens, New York City**. Recently he received a job offer from a great company in **Manhattan** with great career prospects. To make life easier, he wants to move to Manhattan to get rid of the annoying traffic. However, he really enjoys his neighborhood in Flushing, mainly because of many great amenities and other types of venues that exist in the neighborhood, such as various kinds of restaurants, bakery shop and so on. It would be great if we can help him determine neighborhoods on the other side of the city that are **similar to his current neighborhood**.\n",

    "- **(1) Use DBSCAN (Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise) as the machine learning method to cluster neighborhoods for further studies.** In this project, we use traditional K-Means clustering to group data in an unsupervised way. However, when applied to tasks with arbitrary shaped clusters or clusters within clusters, traditional techniques might not be able to achieve good results that is, elements in the same cluster might not share enough similarity or the performance may be poor. Additionally, while partitioning based algorithms such as K-Means may be easy to understand and implement in practice, the algorithm has no notion of outliers that is, all points are assigned to a cluster even if they do not belong in any. Therefore, in the future research, we may want to apply DBSCAN model to analyze clusters."
